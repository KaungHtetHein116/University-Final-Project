# University-Final-Project

##### This project is a full stack web application that uses MySQL as database, SQL, PHP as backend languages, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, BootStrap are used as frontend services.

###### The plastic bag sizer chooser project aims to be part of the future technology projects. The project uses mainly a barcode scanner and a Raspberry Pi3 Model B+ to interact with digital devices and interactive objects. Multiple programming languages are used in order to create user interface websites and interconnection with database. Basically, the project chooses the appropriate bag size according to the items that the users input via barcode scanner. LED lights connected with Raspberry Pi are outputs to represent the selected bag sizes. Sizes and weights of each item are the determinants of the bag size choosing program. The parameter of the items along with barcode numbers are stored in a table format in the MySQL database. Users can interact with the system using user-friendly website user. There are two types of user: Administrator and Customers. Modifying the data of the products inside the database is the function that only administrators can do. For customers’ perspective, they are permitted to use a barcode scanner on their own in order to make the system choose the right bag size depending on item parameters. The usage of the bags on each day and other details are stored in the same database to create the dashboard additionally.

## Algorithm

###### The algorithm of problem-solving operation in choosing bag size is written in PHP programming. When user is ready to check out from the counter, the bag size choosing program will start. This program is written in PHP with embedded SQL query languages together. The reason why PHP is chosen is because it is the simplest language to make interconnection with MySQL database. PHP creates the choosing program and SQL makes manipulation with data set to act upon. When developing a PHP application, it’ll need to create a connection to a database, then be able to insert, delete, and/or select data. SQL provides a structured language to query the database with.
